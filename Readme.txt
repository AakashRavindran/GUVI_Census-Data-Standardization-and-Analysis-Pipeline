This script processes census data for various districts in India, particularly focusing on those in Telangana. 
The main goals of the script are to clean the data, fill in missing values, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or storage in a database.

Features
1.Data Import: Loads census data from a CSV file.
2.Data Cleaning: Renames columns for better clarity and formats district names.
3.Missing Value Handling: Fills missing values in critical columns using logical assumptions and existing data.
4.Data Export: Prepares the data for export to MongoDB.


Dependencies
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
pymongo: For interacting with MongoDB.
sqlalchemy: For SQL database interaction.
psycopg2: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.

The script starts by importing necessary libraries:


import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text
import psycopg2


Helper Functions
1. format_dist_name(name)
This function formats district names by capitalizing the first letter of each word, except for "and"

2. fill_missing_education(df)
This function fills missing values for various education-related columns based on the total education count




A list of districts in Telangana is defined for later use:
TELENGANA_DIST = ["Adilabad", "Nizamabad", "Karimnagar", ...]


The census data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame:
census_data = pd.read_csv("census_2011 - census_2011.csv.csv")

Data Processing Tasks
GUVI TASK 1: Rename Columns
The script renames various columns in the DataFrame for clarity


GUVI TASK 2: Format District Names
It applies the formatting function to the "District" column

GUVI TASK 3: Update State Information
Specific districts are updated to reflect their correct state

GUVI TASK 4: Handle Missing Values
The script fills in missing population, literacy, households, and age-related data using logical assumptions

GUVI TASK 5: Import Processed Data to MongoDB
Finally, the processed DataFrame is prepared for import into MongoDB

This script processes census data for various districts in India, particularly focusing on those in Telangana. 
The main goals of the script are to clean the data, fill in missing values, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or storage in a database.

Features
1.Data Import: Loads census data from a CSV file.
2.Data Cleaning: Renames columns for better clarity and formats district names.
3.Missing Value Handling: Fills missing values in critical columns using logical assumptions and existing data.
4.Data Export: Prepares the data for export to MongoDB.


Dependencies
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
pymongo: For interacting with MongoDB.
sqlalchemy: For SQL database interaction.
psycopg2: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.

The script starts by importing necessary libraries:


import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text
import psycopg2


Helper Functions
1. format_dist_name(name)
This function formats district names by capitalizing the first letter of each word, except for "and"

2. fill_missing_education(df)
This function fills missing values for various education-related columns based on the total education count




A list of districts in Telangana is defined for later use:
TELENGANA_DIST = ["Adilabad", "Nizamabad", "Karimnagar", ...]


The census data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame:
census_data = pd.read_csv("census_2011 - census_2011.csv.csv")

Data Processing Tasks
GUVI TASK 1: Rename Columns
The script renames various columns in the DataFrame for clarity


GUVI TASK 2: Format District Names
It applies the formatting function to the "District" column

GUVI TASK 3: Update State Information
Specific districts are updated to reflect their correct state

GUVI TASK 4: Handle Missing Values
The script fills in missing population, literacy, households, and age-related data using logical assumptions

GUVI TASK 5: Import Processed Data to MongoDB
Finally, the processed DataFrame is prepared for import into MongoDB







README : Data Analysis

This script connects to a PostgreSQL database containing census data and executes various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. 
The results of these queries can be utilized for data analysis, reporting, and visualization.


Dependencies
pandas: For data manipulation and handling DataFrames.
sqlalchemy: For creating a connection to the PostgreSQL database.


Import Libraries
The script starts by importing the necessary libraries

import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text


set pandas display options
pd.set_option("display.max_columns", 120)
pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 120)


Defines connection parameters for the PostgreSQL database:

SQL Queries
The script executes a series of SQL queries to gather insights on various census metrics. Below is a summary of each task:

What is the total population of each district?
How many literate males and females are there in each district?
What is the percentage of workers (both male and female) in each district?
How many households have access to LPG or PNG as a cooking fuel in each district?
What is the religious composition (Hindus, Muslims, Christians, etc.) of each district?
How many households have internet access in each district?
What is the educational attainment distribution (below primary, primary, middle, secondary, etc.) in each district?
How many households have access to various modes of transportation (bicycle, car, radio, television, etc.) in each district?
What is the condition of occupied census houses (dilapidated, with separate kitchen, with bathing facility, with latrine facility, etc.) in each district?
How is the household size distributed (1 person, 2 persons, 3-5 persons, etc.) in each district?
What is the total number of households in each state?
How many households have a latrine facility within the premises in each state?
What is the average household size in each state?
How many households are owned versus rented in each state?
What is the distribution of different types of latrine facilities (pit latrine, flush latrine, etc.) in each state?
How many households have access to drinking water sources near the premises in each state?
What is the average household income distribution in each state based on the power parity categories?
What is the percentage of married couples with different household sizes in each state?
How many households fall below the poverty line in each state based on the power parity categories?
What is the overall literacy rate (percentage of literate population) in each state?
